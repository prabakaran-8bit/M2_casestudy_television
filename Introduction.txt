Television is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in black-and-white or in color,
and in two or three dimensions and sound. Most television sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs.
Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by 
the mid-2010s.In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs.
